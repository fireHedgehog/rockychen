    <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>

    <p>
        I am writing to express my interest in the <strong>Lecturer/Senior Lecturer</strong> position in Computer
        Sciences and Information Technology at Massey University. I have recently completed my Ph.D. in Computer and
        Information Sciences at Auckland University of Technology, with the degree formally conferred and the graduation
        ceremony pending. My research focused on deep learning and audio signal processing, specifically musical
        instrument recognition using multi-spectrogram and attention-based models.
    </p>

    <p>
        Alongside my research, I have supported student learning as a teaching assistant for the <em>Data Mining and
        Machine Learning</em> course (COMP809) at AUT. My responsibilities included assisting during lab sessions,
        answering student queries, and helping students apply theoretical knowledge in practical tasks. I value the
        opportunity to contribute to both undergraduate and postgraduate teaching, and I am open to participating in
        curriculum development, research supervision, and interdisciplinary collaboration.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have practical experience in machine learning (using <em>TensorFlow</em> and <em>PyTorch</em>), Python
        programming, computer vision, and model interpretability. I believe these skills can complement the School of
        Mathematical & Computational Sciences and contribute to ongoing projects across campuses.
    </p>

    <p>
        I hold a <strong>New Zealand resident visa</strong> and a <strong>Chinese passport</strong>, which allows me to
        travel freely between New Zealand and China. I understand that this role involves teaching at both Massey
        University campuses (Albany or Manawatū) and the School of International Education at HEBUT in China, and I am
        fully prepared and willing to take on this commitment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for considering my application.
    </p>
