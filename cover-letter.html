<p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>

<p>
    I am writing to express my interest in the Lecturer / Senior Lecturer position in [placeholder] My Ph.D. in Computer and Information Sciences was recently conferred by Auckland
    University of Technology, with the graduation ceremony pending. My research focused on deep learning and audio
    signal processing, particularly for musical instrument recognition using multi-spectrogram and attention-based
    models.
</p>

<p>
    Beyond research, I have had the opportunity to support student learning as a teaching assistant in data mining and
    machine learning (AUT-COMP809). This involved assisting with lab sessions, providing guidance on assignments, and
    helping students connect theoretical concepts with practical applications. I appreciate Massey’s emphasis on both
    in-person and online teaching and would welcome the chance to contribute where I can, including in course
    development, research supervision, and collaborative efforts.
</p>

<p>
    I bring expertise in machine learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch), Python programming, computer vision, and model
    interpretability. These skills may complement the School’s strengths and align with Massey’s vision for impactful,
    interdisciplinary research.
</p>
